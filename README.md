# üè† Price It Right: Predicting Home Sale Speed from List Price

**Can you predict how long it will take to sell a house based on the list price?**  
This project uses real housing data using webscraping and machine learning to estimate how list price influences time-on-market.

We built a model that helps homeowners, realtors, and investors optimize listing strategies by forecasting the expected sale timeframe‚Äîbased on just a few features like location, list price, and market trends.
